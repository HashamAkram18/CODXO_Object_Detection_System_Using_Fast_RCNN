## Features

- Detects wheat crops in images using an RCNN model.
- Provides bounding boxes around detected crops.
- Supports both training and inference modes.
- Visualizes detection results with bounding boxes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wheat-crop-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd wheat-crop-detection
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Inference

To run inference on a single image:

```python
from model import RCNNModel  # Import your RCNN model class
import cv2

# Load the trained model
model = RCNNModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path_to_trained_model.pth'))
model.eval()

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')

# Perform detection
detections = model.detect(image)

# Visualize results
model.visualize_detections(image, detections)
```

### Training the Model

To train the model on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format (images and annotations).
2. Use the following command to start training:

```python
python train.py --data_dir path_to_data --num_epochs 50
```

Replace `path_to_data` with the path to your dataset.

## Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using:

```python
python evaluate.py --model_path path_to_trained_model.pth --data_dir path_to_test_data
```

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU). Results will be saved in the `results` directory.

## Limitations

- The model may struggle with images containing overlapping crops or occlusions.
- Performance may vary based on the quality and variety of the training dataset.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different architectures (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse images of wheat crops.
